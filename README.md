# Basic-Portfolio

This is a basic porfolio template designed using **HTML** and **CSS**. This template includes a Home Page with an About Me section, a Porfolio Page, and a Contact Page. Each page includes a nav-bar, a main section, an aside with links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and StackOverflow, and a footer. Please see the video below for a quick walkthrough of the design.
